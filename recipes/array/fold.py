def fold(a, wsize, overlap=0, axis=0, pad='masked', **kws):
    """
    Fold (window) an array along a given `axis` at given `size`, with successive
    windows overlapping each previous by `overlap` elements.  This method
    works on masked arrays as well and will fold the mask identically to the
    data. By default the array is padded out with masked elements so that the
    step size evenly divides the array along the given axis.

    Parameters
    ----------
    a
    wsize
    overlap
    axis
    pad
    kws
        Keywords are passed to `np.pad` which pads up the array to the required
        length.

    Returns
    -------

    Notes
    -----
    When overlap is nonzero, the array returned by this function will have
    multiple entries **with the same memory location**.  Beware of this when
    doing inplace arithmetic operations on the returned array.
    eg.:
    >>> n, size, overlap = 100, 10, 5
    >>> q = fold(np.arange(n), size, overlap)
    >>> k = 0
    >>> q[0, overlap + k] *= 10
    >>> q[1, k] == q[0, overlap + k]
    True
