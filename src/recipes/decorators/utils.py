class sharedmethod(classmethod):  # source astropy
    """
    This is a method decorator that allows both an instancemethod and a
    `classmethod` to share the same name.

    When using `sharedmethod` on a method defined in a class's body, it
    may be called on an instance, or on a class.  In the former case it
    behaves like a normal instance method (a reference to the instance is
    automatically passed as the first ``self`` argument of the method)::

        >>> class Example:
        ...     @sharedmethod
        ...     def identify(self, *args):
        ...         print('self was', self)
        ...         print('additional args were', args)
        ...
        >>> ex = Example()
        >>> ex.identify(1, 2)
        self was <astropy.utils.decorators.Example object at 0x...>
        additional args were (1, 2)

    In the latter case, when the `sharedmethod` is called directly from a
    class, it behaves like a `classmethod`::

        >>> Example.identify(3, 4)
        self was <class 'astropy.utils.decorators.Example'>
        additional args were (3, 4)

    This also supports a more advanced usage, where the `classmethod`
    implementation can be written separately.  If the class's *metaclass*
    has a method of the same name as the `sharedmethod`, the version on
    the metaclass is delegated to::

        >>> class ExampleMeta(type):
        ...     def identify(self):
        ...         print('this implements the {0}.identify '
        ...               'classmethod'.format(self.__name__))
        ...
        >>> class Example(metaclass=ExampleMeta):
        ...     @sharedmethod
        ...     def identify(self):
        ...         print('this implements the instancemethod')
        ...
        >>> Example().identify()
        this implements the instancemethod
        >>> Example.identify()
        this implements the Example.identify classmethod
